	<h1>About Berea College Physics</h1>
	<div class="row rw-2">
		<div class="col-lg-6 text-justify">
			<p>The Department of Physics offers a full set of courses,
			 labor opportunities, and other activities designed to (a)
			 prepare students to enter graduate schools or research laboratories
			 en route to careers as professional physicists, (b) provide a liberal
			 arts major for students who will not become physicists but are interested
			 in careers in astronomy, engineering, medicine, computer science, secondary
			 teaching etc., where a background in physics is essential, and (c) provide
			 service courses for majors in other sciences such as pre-medicine, mathematics,
			 technology and applied design, and agriculture.  We are committed to providing
			 quality education. The physics curriculum at Berea College is flexible and comprehensive.
			 Our courses are grounded in problem solving using both practical and quantitative reasoning skills.
			 We also are committed to the idea that students should conduct research as part of their undergraduate
			 curriculum. Our Faculty direct undergraduate research with our students as well
			 as send some of our students to undergraduate research programs at other institutions.
			 Berea College has a long-standing Dual Degree Engineering Program that includes an exchange
			 agreement with the University of Kentucky. In this dual degree program, a student
			 begins his/her college career at Berea, taking General Education, science, mathematics
			 and other course work, then transfer to the <a href="http://www.engr.uky.edu/">University of Kentucky</a> in Lexington, Kentucky
			 for his/her professional engineering education. Upon completion of both programs,
			 students will earn two baccalaureate degrees, one from each of two institutions
			 they attended. Although Berea college does not have a special agreement with any
			 other engineering school, some Berea students have, nevertheless, successfully
			 entered dual degree engineering programs with other universities.</p>
