	<h1>About The Society of Physics Students</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="container-fluid">
			<p>The Society of Physics Students (SPS) has more than 6,000 members in nearly 700
			   colleges and universities. An active SPS chapter provides the professional development opportunities 
			   that course work cannot teach, including development of communication and professional networking skills, undergraduate research and 
			   science literacy outreach to the community.</p>

			<p>The SPS chapter can also be a physics department's most effective recruitment and retention tool. An active chapter helps 
			   to transform students from being mere class attendees to being contributing members of a professional community.
			   And it certainly does not require its members to be physics students! Anyone interested in physics or its applications can be a member of both the
			   national organization and the local chapter.</p>

<p>The Society of Physics Students at Johns Hopkins is the 3,371st chapter of SPS. We believe SPS has great effects on communications between 
undergraduate physics students at Hopkins. Not only is SPS responsible for the information exchange and link between the faculty and the students,
 but it also serves as a social environment for undergraduate physics majors.

Being a member here at JHU means coming to the meetings, being on the JHU SPS mailing list, being eligible for the annual trip and having access 
to the SPS office. To join the national SPS, you must send $20 and an information form to the national headquarters. For more information, go here.

If you enjoy hearing about current research in physics, helping others to understand physics and having fun, then you should consider being a member
 of the Society of Physics Students at JHU. We hope to see you at our meetings! </p>
