			<h1>About The Society of Physics Students</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="container-fluid">
				<p>The Society of Physics Students (SPS) has more than 6,000 members in nearly 700 colleges and universities. An active SPS chapter provides the professional development opportunities that course work cannot teach, including development of communication
					and professional networking skills, undergraduate research and science literacy outreach to the community.</p>

				<p>The SPS chapter can also be a physics department's most effective recruitment and retention tool. An active chapter helps to transform students from being mere class attendees to being contributing members of a professional community. And it certainly
					does not require its members to be physics students! Anyone interested in physics or its applications can be a member of both the national organization and the local chapter.</p>

				<p>The Society of Physics Students at Berea College is the 508th chapter of SPS. We believe SPS has great effects on communications between undergraduate physics students at Hopkins. Not only is SPS responsible for the information exchange and link between
					the faculty and the students, but it also serves as a social environment for undergraduate physics majors.</p>

				<p>Being a member at Berea College means coming to the meetings and being on the Berea College Outlook Group mailing list. To join the national SPS, you must send $20 and an information form to the national headquarters. For more information, go <a href="https://www.spsnational.org/about">here.</a>					To join the national organization, go <a href="https://www.spsnational.org/about/membership">here</a></p>

				<p>If you enjoy hearing about current research in physics, helping others to understand physics and having fun, then you should consider being a member of the Society of Physics Students at Berea College. We hope to see you at our meetings! </p>
